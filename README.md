# ericsebesta/unity-unitytemplate-urp
An empty Unity Universal Render Pipeline-based project based off of Unity 2019.4.1f1

Users should be able to use this as a template repo, clone it, open and build (windows at least) successfully and w/o making any changes that would be submitted back into git. It also includes an initialized industry-standard testing folder and file structure. Test away!

Features:
- Derived from the default "Universal Render Pipeline" Unity starting project template.
- All assets removed except for the default skybox.
- Uses "main" as default branch.
- Up-to-date .gitignore.
- Not-critical packages removed.
- Core packages updated (timeline, rider, etc.).
  - Note this does mean that this template uses non-verified packages.
- All standard directories initialized (using a placeholder file).
- Trival sample scene with very basic industry standard gameobject organization (cameras holder object, lights holder object, etc).
- Unit testing frameworks setup with sample trivial tests.
- 0 Rider inspection errors/warnings/suggestions/etc.
- Reasonable default player settings (windowed, no splash screen, etc).
